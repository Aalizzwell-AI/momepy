# momepy
Urban Morphology Measuring Toolkit

## Introduction
Momepy is a project allowing advanced quantitative analysis of urban morphology. Embracing principles of *Urban Morphometrics* (Dibble, 2017), this toolkit aims to provide tools for the development of complex frameworks for a description of urban structures.

> *momepy* stands for Morphological Measuring in Python

The development of momepy is still in its initial phase. The whole structure of the package can always be changed, until the release of first versions on PIP. Momepy is a result of ongoing research of [Urban Design Studies Unit (UDSU)](http://udsu-strath.com) supported by the Axel and Margaret Ax:son Johnson Foundation as a part of The Urban Form Resilience Project.

Comments, suggestions, feedback, and contributions, as well as bug reports, are very welcome.

## Install
Momepy is not yet released. At this moment, you can download the GitHub repository to work with `momepy`. Installation from GitHub via PIP is on the roadmap soon.

Momepy depends on the following packages:
- `geopandas`
- (the list is currently incomplete. All of the packages are currently required, which should be changed in future.)
